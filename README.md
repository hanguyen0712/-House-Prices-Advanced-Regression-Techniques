# -House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques
Submission for a Kaggle challenge that aims to predict house sales price.

I preprocessed the data by assigning numerical values to categorical variables with levels, and applying onehot encoding to other categorical variables. I then aligned the predictors in the training set and the test set with an inner join. 

The in-sample R^2 is 0.87.
The Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error for the out-of-sample prediction is 0.24313.
